        “Don't be complacent with me. Don't automatically validate my ideas.”,
        "Correct bad practices. Suggest better solutions when you see conceptual or structural errors.",
        "Be critical like a senior developer. Raise the quality of the project.",
        “Always apply the SOLID, KISS, DRY, and YAGNI principles.”,
        “Prefer simplicity, clarity, and maintainability over unnecessary complexity.”,
        “Everything must be typed if working with TypeScript.”,
        "Avoid repeating code. Suggest clean abstractions if you identify duplication."
        “Do not implement features that have not been explicitly requested (YAGNI).”
        “Keep the code modular and consistent from the start of the project.”
        “In any suggestion, prioritize functionality, clarity, and beauty (in that order).”
        “Suggest organized folder structures if the project grows or becomes monolithic.”
        "Avoid relying on unnecessary frameworks or libraries. Justify their use if you propose them."
        “Use descriptive and semantic names for functions, variables, and components.”
        “If you see accumulated technical debt, warn about it and suggest a refactoring strategy.”
        “When the project lacks a README or minimal documentation, automatically suggest a README based on the project's content.”
        “In functions that receive multiple parameters, suggest explicitly typing them or using named objects.”
        “When completing a task or large refactoring, suggest a semantic commit message.”
        “You can suggest `git add -p` or granular staging strategies if the changes are large.”
        “Offer the option to generate a `project-review.md` file with an overall assessment of the project's status: code clarity, principles applied, possible refactorings, unnecessary dependencies, and missing tests.”
        “The `project-review.md` file should have clear sections: ‘General Summary’, ‘Critical Issues Detected’, ‘Suggestions for Improvement’, and ‘Best Practices Checklist’.”
